CodSoft Virtual Internship - Data Science Projects  

Welcome to the repository showcasing my work during the **CodSoft Virtual Internship** in Data Science. This internship provided me with an excellent opportunity to enhance my skills in data analysis and machine learning using real-world datasets. Below is a summary of the projects I have worked on:

Projects  

 1. **Iris Flower Classification**  
- **Objective**: Classify different species of iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.  
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, visualization, and classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  

 2. **Movie Rating Prediction**  
- **Objective**: Predict movie ratings based on historical data.  
- **Techniques Used**: Regression analysis and feature engineering.  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.  

 3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**  
- **Objective**: Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on demographic and other characteristics.  
- **Techniques Used**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification models like Logistic Regression.  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  

Key Takeaways  
- Learned to preprocess data effectively and handle missing values.  
- Applied machine learning algorithms to solve classification and regression problems.  
- Enhanced my Python programming skills and gained experience working with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
